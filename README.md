##Oneboxes links to Github repos, issues or pull requests in Chat

This userscript will automatically detect **new *and* existing** messages in chat that link to Github and onebox them, just like it is done already for posts on SE sites. Inspired by [One-box repositories, issue tickets and such on GitHub in the chat](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/243259/260841) on Meta.

##Install

I recommend you use a userscript manager such as Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey because they make it much easier for you to manager userscripts.

Feature requests and bug reports are welcome as issues at the [Github repo](https://github.com/shu8/SEChat-githubOneboxer). Pull requests are even more welcome! ;)

You can test it in any chat room, or in [the Sandbox](http://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/rooms/651/); [just like I did](http://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/rooms/651/conversation/github-link-oneboxer-testing) :) 

I've posted this on Code Review to get it reviewed and will update it at Github if and when I get any answers over there! :)
